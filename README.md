E-commerce website project
welcome to my peoject 
my project is a simple e-commerce website that contains about 8 pages 
    ⦁	home 
    ⦁	products 
    ⦁	cart 
    ⦁	login 
    ⦁	sign up 
    ⦁	dashboard 
    ⦁	oreders management 
    ⦁	products management 

- the most of the pages has a navigation header to navigate the site 
      and containes a footer that have contact info and some useful links .
- in the design prosses we consider designing a very responsive site that works perfectly  with differnet screen sizes. 

1 - Home Page (index.html)
      the landing page in the site is the home page ( index.html ) that contains nav header , newst products , some categories and footer .
  
2 - Products Page 
      in products page you can view  product details ,add products to cart and view cart from the nav bar .
  
3 - Cart Page   
      - any product added to cart by the user will apear incart section .
      - the right column of the page contain order details such as price , shipping and total price 
      - there is remove button for each product so user can remove any unwanted product fronthe cart
      - when the user press comtinue the browser will automaticaly route him to  the login page 
    
4 - Login Page - Sign Up page
      the login page have 3 options 
      1- login by email and password 
      2- sign up if the user is not registerd 
      3- login to site dashboard
      ( note : the logic of verfication isn't working so buttons will take the user to the desired pages without verfying authentication )  
 
5 - Admin pages ( dashboard - orders - products management )
      ( visual only pages that has no functionality )

6 - Responsiveness 
      I've used css properties like ( flex - media querry ) to make the adabt to smaller screens like maobles and tablets
